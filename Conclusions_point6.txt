Certain initial clusters can be observed in the datasets, for example in the noyse_circles dataset
it can be said that 2 clusters are observed, just like noisy_moons.

For datasets that are not linear and with some defined behavior, better performance is observed in DBSCAN and spectral clustering,
For data sets where no initial trend is observed but scattered points, KMeans and Kmedoids behave better.
